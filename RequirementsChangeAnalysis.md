# Requirements Change Analysis for Sprint 05

## Overview of the Requirements Change

**Requirement Change:** Allow patrons to create public collections (not private) and track who created a collection so that only creators can add, edit, and delete items from their collections.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Collection Functionality
- Librarians can create both public and private collections
- Collections can be viewed by appropriate users (public for all, private for authorized users)
- Currently no tracking of who created a collection
- No restrictions on who can modify a collection

### Identified Changes Required

1. **Data Model Changes:**
   - Add a `creator` field to the `Collection` model to track ownership
   - Make existing collections backward compatible

2. **User Interface Changes:**
   - Update collection templates to display creator information
   - Add conditional logic in templates to only show add/remove actions to creators
   - Disable private collection option for patrons

3. **Business Logic Changes:**
   - Restrict patrons from creating private collections
   - Add permission checks in views to only allow creators to modify collections

## Implementation Strategy

### Model Changes
- Add a `creator` field to `Collection` model as a `ForeignKey` to the `User` model
- Use `null=True, blank=True` to allow for backward compatibility with existing collections
- Create a data migration to assign existing collections to a default user

### Controller/View Changes
- Modify `create_collection` view to:
  - Set the creator field to the current user
  - Block patrons from creating private collections
- Update `add_to_collection` and `remove_from_collection` views to:
  - Check if the current user is the creator before allowing modifications

### Template Changes
- Update collection detail template to:
  - Display creator information
  - Only show add/remove buttons to the creator
- Update collection list template to:
  - Show creator for each collection
  - Disable private collection option for patrons in the create form

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test that patrons cannot create private collections
   - Test that only creators can modify collections
   - Test that collections correctly display creator information

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test the flow of creating, viewing, and modifying collections by different user types
   - Test backward compatibility with existing collections

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Test as both patron and librarian users
   - Verify UI elements appear/disappear appropriately based on user type and creator status

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Data Migration Risk:**
   - Existing collections without creators could cause issues
   - **Mitigation:** Create a migration script to set a default creator

2. **User Experience Risk:**
   - Users may be confused by suddenly not having access to modify collections
   - **Mitigation:** Clear UI elements and helpful error messages

3. **Performance Risk:**
   - Additional checks for creator status could impact performance
   - **Mitigation:** Index the creator field for efficient queries

## Timeline

1. **Week 1:**
   - Implement model changes
   - Create migration scripts
   - Update controller logic

2. **Week 2:**
   - Update templates
   - Testing
   - Documentation and deployment

## Conclusion

The implementation approach focuses on minimizing disruption to existing functionality while adding the new patron collection capabilities. By tracking creators and implementing appropriate permission checks, we ensure a clean separation of responsibilities between creators and viewers of collections.
